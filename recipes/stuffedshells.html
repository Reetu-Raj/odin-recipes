        <li>Half a can of pureed tomatoes</li>
        <li>A quarter of an onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>

        <li>Fresh basil</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Chilli flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To make the marinara sauce, first combine pureed tomatoes, onion, garlic, dried oregano, chilli flakes, and olive oil in a pot.</li>
      <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then lower the heat and allow it to continue simmering for about 45 minutes, until droplets of oil are visible on the surface of the sauce.</li>
      <li>Add salt and/or pepper to taste, then set the sauce aside.</li>
      <li>In a pan, cook the shells in salt water according to packet instructions, but undercook by one minute so they are firmer for the process of filling.</li>
      <li>Run the shells under cold water and drain, then set aside.</li>
      <li>To make the filling, combine the parmesan, mozzerella, ricotta, basil, salt and pepper in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Carefully fill each shell with 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture, while making sure that the shells do not break and the filling does not spill out of the shells.</li>
      <li>Pour the marinara sauce into a pan so that the sauce just covers the entire base of the pan. Lay the filled shells on top of the sauce and sprinkle more cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Cover and cook for a few minutes. The dish is ready when all the cheese on top has melted.</li>
    </ol>
