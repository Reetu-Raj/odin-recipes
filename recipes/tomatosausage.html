    <p><i>Serves 2</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of pureed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half an onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>250g dried pasta of any kind</li>
        <li>6 spicy sausages, chopped into circular pieces</li>

        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Ricotta to serve</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To make the marinara sauce, first combine pureed tomatoes, onion, garlic, dried oregano, chilli flakes, and olive oil in a pot.</li>
      <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then lower the heat and allow it to continue simmering for about 45 minutes, until droplets of oil are visible on the surface of the sauce.</li>
      <li>Add salt and/or pepper to taste, then set the sauce aside.</li>
      <li>In a pan, fry the sausage pieces until they are brown on both sides. For extra flavor, do not discard the oil that is left in the pan after frying the sausages.</li>
      <li>In a separate pan, cook the pasta until al dente in salted water according to packet instructions.</li>
      <li>Drain the pasta, place it back in a pan, and mix in the marinara sauce, sausages, and oil resserved from the fried sausages.</li>
      <li>Top the pasta with a few spoonfuls of ricotta and garnish with torn basil leaves before serving. Add more chilli flakes to taste.</li>
    </ol>
