    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>While carbonara is usually made with bacon, this recipe uses parma ham as a healthier - and equally delicious - alternative.</p>
    <p>Let's get started!</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <p><em>Serves 2</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 slices of parma ham, cut into strips</li>
        <li>250g dried pasta of any kind</li>
        <li>2 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>40g grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley OR dried parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Fry the strips of parma ham in a frying pan, without adding oil, until they turn crisp. Set them aside.</li>
       <li>Combine the eggs, egg yolk, garlic, and parmesan in a bowl and mix, then set the mixture aside.</li>
       <li>In a pan, cook the pasta until al dente in salted water according to packet instructions.</li> 
       <li>Drain away most of the pasta water, leaving only about one ladle-full of pasta water in the pan.</li>
       <li>Add the egg mixture into the pan with the pasta, and stir until the pasta is coated in the sauce, for about 2 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add in the strips of parma ham and mix.</li>
       <li>Serve with ground black pepper, parsley, and more cheese.</li>
    </ol>
